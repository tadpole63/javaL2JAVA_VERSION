# javaL2JAVA_VERSION
Java level two application prompts JAVA VERSION.  

This is the original version of the "java l2 prompts PYTHON VERSION" found at https://github.com/tadpole63/JavaLevel2Prompts-pythonVersion
These applications are VERY bare bones applications, watch for separate repositories containing more elaborate versions of these applications.  

Please feel free to use any of my ideas to develop your own code!  That's the whole reason I post my applications here.  If you end up using my code to create your own application, go ahead and message me with what you've done with it.  I'd love to see what any of you do with my brain children.  

Lastly, if you do end up using my code, have fun with it.  Make it something new.  Or make your own application expanding on any of mine.  Just have fun with it!
